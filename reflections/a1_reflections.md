Activity 1 reflection
It was overall a pretty difficult activity, but I am sure it is only going to get more difficult. I managed to complete it with what I know. Question 6 and 7 were two questions that I was stuck on for quite a while. It was only until I got help from a classmate is when I understood what the material was asking me to do. Question 6 was about identifying a data type. I thought I knew how to do it, but it shows that I didn’t really know. The AI on the colon is quite distracting and I get mixed up when trying to find how to actually do it. Question 7 was about adding 10 to your name and I wasn’t sure whatI had to do, so I did omething that I thought was right, but it was in the back ofmind when submitting my assignemnt. Overall, while completing the assignment I visted work that we did in the classroom to guide me and when doing it, it was fair.
