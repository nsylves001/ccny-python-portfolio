This assignment was fair and wasn't too difficult for me. I could be exaggerating and have done the entire assignment wrong, I hope I did it correctly. I used the resources that we previously used in class to help us do the assignments. I used Melanie Walsh's book on Command line tools and Python. It helped me create a tutorial without sounding dumb. I am glad that I was able to understand what I was writing. I made this tutorial with language specifically that I can understand because sometimes I need to break down terms or phrases in order to understand them, which is why I hate reading. I hope you are able to understand my tutorial as well. I fully enjoyed doing this assignment because it wasn't asking of too much and it was asking for me to put the little skills I knwo to use. I am proud of the work I have done.
