Activity 2 was the most strenous activity to date for me because I didn't understand a lot of the terms or I couldn't folow the examples accurately. I learned how to create a list, sort a list, and define functions. I have been working on this assignment for some time and I asked my dad for help. My dad didn't really do much in terms of helping because he is a person who likes to take shortcuts. I would have finished faster, if I knew how to comprehend readings. I was having the most trouble with the defining functions section. I read all of the readings reccomended and I couldn't really do it. I got a rundown of what to do from a classmae and that helped me finish ACtivity 2 to the best of my ability. 
P.S. Hope I get one extra point for the not doing the full extra credit. =)
